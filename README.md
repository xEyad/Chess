A wonderful chess game with Awesome graphics and Multiplayer feature up to 2 players.
can played by 2 to 1 player(s) -it depends on your mood-
* I expected to play against AI, where is it? 
- I couldn't implement such a horrible feature which you won't be able to coup with. it may lead to the destruction of your nervous system thus, i left it for future plans.

Have fun.

This project's sole purpose is to be a DEMO, it represents everything i had learned since starting C++ programming 
it's created from scratch (including Graphics) using 
* visual studio 2015 community
* directx
* chili framework (can be downloaded from here https://goo.gl/qgqvmK)
* c++11 , c++14

Thanks to Chili's awesome tutorials and planet-chili community for there support and help.

Note: don't run the game in Debug mode, cause it will be very very laggy/un-responsive, just use Release mode.
